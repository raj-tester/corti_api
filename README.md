Project Description:

Node.js Framework used are:TestCafe

Instruction:
install testcafe globally using: npm install -g testcafe 

File Structure:

I have followed Page Object Model and have tried to maintain the hierarchy displayed at amazon.in 

Page folder: This folder will contains all the {page}.js file which would have all the elements present on that page.

Test Data Folder: This folder will have js files containing the test data which would like to pass for our test scenarios. for example, I have added the user filter for shoes like the company, and size user wants to select and then these filters would be passed on to the Product filter js files.

Product Filter: This folder will have js files which would get filter data from test Data and later it will apply filters so that it could be used directly into our test

Util folder: This folder will have js files which would need to perform common actions on webpages.

Test : This folder will have all test js files.
